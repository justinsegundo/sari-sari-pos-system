# Sari-Sari POS System

## Overview
The Sari-Sari POS System is a Java-based point-of-sale application designed for small neighborhood stores ("sari-sari stores"). I built this system to solve common challenges in managing inventory, tracking product prices, and keeping stock records manually. This system makes these tasks faster, easier, and more accurate.

## Features
- Add, edit, and delete products directly in the table using intuitive buttons with icons.
- Quickly check product prices using the Price Checker tab with keyword search.
- Track stock levels and product information efficiently.
- Alternating row colors in tables for improved readability.
- Clean and responsive interface for smooth user experience.
